# NativeScript Core Blank Template
App templates help you jump start your native cross-platform apps with built-in UI elements and best practices. Save time writing boilerplate code over and over again when you create new apps.

## Quick Start
Execute the following command to create an app from this template:

```
tns create my-app-name --template https://github.com/NativeScript/template-blank
```

## Walkthrough

### Architecture
There is a single blank component located in:
- `/home/home-page.js` - sets up an empty page layout.

**Home** page has the following components:
- `ActionBar` - It holds the title of the page.
- `GridLayout` - The main page layout that should contains all the page content.
